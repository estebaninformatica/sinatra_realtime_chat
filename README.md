A little irc app using sinatra streaming!

You can see it online [Sinatra realtime app](http://sinatra-realtime-chat.herokuapp.com)

Objective 
---------

Well, I just wanted to learn Sinatra and also I'm interested in using the the streaming capabilities built in with it. 
So basically that's that.

Dependencies
------------

* sinatra
* data_mapper
* thin (seems like Webrick just is not able to handle connections)
* pg (Postgress db access)
